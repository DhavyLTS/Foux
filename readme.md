# Foux Engine (Work in Progress)
foux Engine is an evolving rendering engine crafted in Rust, leveraging the power of OpenGL for graphics rendering. 
This README provides an insight into the project's current state, future roadmap, technological aspects, and envisioned features.

# Technological Aspects
## Rust Language
foux Engine is written in Rust, a modern, safe, and performance-oriented programming language.
Rust's strong type system, memory safety guarantees, and concurrency features contribute to the reliability and efficiency of the engine codebase.

## OpenGL
The engine leverages OpenGL, a widely used graphics API, for hardware-accelerated rendering. 
By directly interfacing with the GPU, OpenGL enables efficient rendering of 3D graphics on various platforms.

## GLFW
For window creation and input handling, foux Engine utilizes GLFW, a lightweight library that provides a simple API for managing windows, contexts, and events.GLFW facilitates cross-platform development by abstracting platform-specific details.

# Features
- Window Management: Create and manage windows.
- Input Handling: Basic user input support.
- Mesh Rendering: Load and render 3D meshes.
- Shader Management: Load and manage vertex and fragment shaders.

# Roadmap
## Version 1.0 (Upcoming)
- Complete input handling
- Basic lighting and shading
- Physics simulation
- Mesh loading optimization
- Error handling and debugging improvements
## Version 1.1 (Future)
- Advanced rendering techniques
- Enhanced physics simulation
- Performance optimization
- Customizable input handling
